Dataset Review and Analysis 

The dataset contains 25 columns of data related to network traffic and attacks. At the beginning of this data, 4 of them were numeric and the rest were object data. First, let me examine the statistical values ​​of the numeric data. Then, I classified the object data according to whether they were unique. I converted all of the unique data into numeric with hash, applied categorical encoding to balanced data, and examined and organized the object data containing NaN. It is currently completely numeric and processed numerically.



Data Preprocessing: In this section, I saw that there was no one-to-one relationship in my dataset and divided the Timstap column into pieces to obtain new features. We had converted the unique columns into numeric with hash, and I analyzed them again using clustering. And I created my final dataset.

Model Selection and Usage

Clustering Algorithms: Algorithms such as KMeans or DBSCAN can be used to group network traffic data and detect attacks. Such clustering methods can be effective in identifying anomalies or unusual behaviors.
Classification Algorithms: If labeled data is available, attack types can be predicted using models such as Logistic Regression, SVM, or Random Forests.
Anomaly Detection: Models such as Isolation Forest or Autoencoder can detect anomalous network behaviors by working with new unlabeled data. data.
Project Scenario This dataset can be used to detect cyber attacks in network traffic for a security company. The main goal is to identify abnormal network traffic and detect potential security breaches in a timely manner. Algorithm Selection

Clustering: It may be useful to identify abnormal situations by grouping network traffic data with KMeans or DBSCAN.
Classification: It is recommended to predict attack types using models such as Logistic Regression, SVM or Random Forest.
Anomaly Detection: You can detect abnormal situations by working with new, unlabeled data with Isolation Forest or Autoencoder.
This model can provide a powerful threat detection tool for a company in the field of network security. urity.
